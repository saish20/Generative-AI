This code demonstrates generative AI capabilities using the GPT-2 language model. The user can input a prompt or a few words, and the model generates text based on the input. The code uses the Streamlit library to create a user interface and display the generated text. The GPT-2 model is loaded using the transformers library, and a function is defined to generate text based on user input. The function takes the user input prompt as input and generates text using the GPT-2 model. The generated text is then displayed to the user in the Streamlit app. Overall, this app demonstrates the power of generative AI in creating realistic and coherent text based on user input.
